This is two rather minimal kernel configs suitable for KVM vm's. They come in i686
and amd64 flavors.

The naming convention (especially the gentoo-part) is heritage. The first kernel
was built as a template for Tilaa's (http://tilaa.nl) gentoo vm.

Only a minimal amount of drivers is built. The config assumes you're running a
decently new kvm host with virtio, virtnet and virt hwclock support.

IPV6 is built as module, so is also most of the network stack (I for instance
use some of the iptables modules). Currently not using devtmpfs, but since it's
something I always deploy with, I'm adding it sooner or later (no need to run udev
on your minimalist servers when mdev from busybox does a most excellent job).
